# Regenerated-Passwords
A password Generator that asks the user for a number of passwords to create, difficulty they would like and the length of these passwords to be created. Then the program shows them their passwords, which are randomly generated. 

## Running the Program
- Right now, running this program is as simple as downloading the Password-gen.py file and running it from the IDE or command line.

- *However, soon it should follow these steps below:*
  1. Ensure that pip3 is installed, then clone the entire repository and then enter the location where you cloned it (Details on how to do that can be found [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Github doc on how to clone"))
  2. Run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to ensure you have all the dependencies on the system you are using to run this program.

## NOTES
This was written in Visual Studio code and does not have a GUI component yet. 

## Upcoming additions
- A Django webframe that will give the user a GUI component to create these passwords and see them in a more user-friendly manner
- Also in the works is a component to give the user a file with these created passwords should they choose to do so
