# Regenerated-Passwords
A password Generator that asks the user for a number of passwords to create, difficulty they would like and the length of these passwords to be created. Then the program shows them their passwords, which are randomly generated. 

## Can be accessed here: https://bhaessler.github.io/Regenerated-Passwords/

## NOTES
This was written in Visual Studio code and does not have a GUI component yet. 

The above link is only for a simple stacic page and has no downloading or saving capabilities, so PLEASE SAVE AND STORE YOUR PASSWORDS IF YOU NEED THEM AGAIN. 

The other password gen code folder contains other simple password algorithms that can be used to create less random passwords (random in the sense that they take user input for the contents of the password instead of being a completely random password creator 

# BELOW HERE ONLY APPLIES FOR THE PYTHON CODE FILES 

## Running the Programa
- Right now, running this program is as simple as downloading the Password-gen.py file and running it from the IDE or command line.

- *However, soon it should follow these steps below:*
  1. Ensure that pip3 is installed, then clone the entire repository and then enter the location where you cloned it (Details on how to do that can be found [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository "Github doc on how to clone"))
  2. Run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to ensure you have all the dependencies on the system you are using to run this program.

## Upcoming additions
- In the works is a component to give the user a file with these created passwords should they choose to do so
- Also a popup window with the passwords contained or printed within it
