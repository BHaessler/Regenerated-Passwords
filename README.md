# Regenerated-Passwords
A password Generator that asks the user for a number of passwords to create, difficulty they would like and the length of these passwords to be created. Then the program shows them their passwords, which are randomly generated. 

## Running the Program
- Right now, running this program is as simple as downloading the Password-gen.py file and running it from the IDE or command line.

## NOTES
This was written in Visual Studio code and does not have a GUI component yet. 

## Upcoming additons
- A Django webframe that will give the user a GUI component to create these passwords and see them in a more user-friendly manner
- Also in the works is a component to give the user a file with these created passwords should they choose to do so
