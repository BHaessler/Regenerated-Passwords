# Regenerated-Passwords
A password Generator that asks the user for a number of passwords to create, difficulty they would like and the length of these passwords to be created. Then the program shows them their passwords, which are randomly generated. 

This was written in Visual Studio code and does not have a GUI component yet. 

Also in the works is a component to give the user a file with these created passwords should they choose to do so.
